# Smart Secure QR Generator

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://smart-secure-qr.netlify.app/

Smart Secure QR Generator is a project that allows users to create **encrypted QR codes** containing personal data such as name, phone, email, and age. The information is encrypted with a password before generating the QR code and can only be decrypted using the same password.

This repository contains **two complementary applications**:

1. **Desktop Application (C + Win32/GDI+)** – A Windows GUI application for generating and saving encrypted QR codes locally.
2. **Web Application (React)** – A browser-based interface that performs QR generation and decryption securely on the client side.

# Running the Web App Locally
cd web/frontend
npm install
npm start

The application will start at:

http://localhost:3000

---

# Building the Production Version
cd web/frontend
npm run build

This generates the `build/` folder which can be deployed to hosting platforms like Netlify.

---

# Deployment (Netlify)

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Go to **Netlify → New site from Git**.
3. Select the repository.
4. Configure build settings:

Build command
npm run build


Publish directory
web/frontend/build


5. Deploy the site.

# Security Model

User data is encrypted before generating the QR code.

Encryption flow:
User Input
↓
AES Encryption (CryptoJS)
↓
Encrypted Text
↓
QR Code Generation


Decryption requires the **same password** used during encryption.

# Future Improvements

- QR code scanner using camera
- Mobile friendly UI
- Save QR history
- Desktop encryption integration
- Cross-platform mobile version
